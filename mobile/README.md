CAMP Mobile is a Flutter rider cockpit for managing a motorcycle fleet, logging post-ride reports, tracking predictive maintenance and trip finances, navigating with offline maps, finding mechanics, and managing rider settings. The implementation uses a tactical **skeuomorphic clay** design system, reactive singleton `ChangeNotifier` state management, and fully offline-first `SharedPreferences` persistence.

> **100% Software-Based Architecture** — CAMP operates on rider-logged data (odometer readings, service records, terrain tags) and standard smartphone GPS. There is **no OBD-II, no ECU polling, no hardware sensor pairing, no fake detection, and no live telemetry hardware**. All wear indicators, service warnings, straight-line distance calculations (Haversine formula), and carburetor guidance are deterministic software calculations derived from user input or GPS.

## State Management & Data Flow

Persistent user data is managed by reactive **ChangeNotifier controllers** and repositories, loaded eagerly in `main()` before `runApp`:

| Controller / Repository | Persists To | Consumed By |
|---|---|---|
| `ActiveBikeController` | `LocalStore` (`camp_bikes`, `camp_active_bike_id`) | Dashboard, Maintenance, Navigation, Garage, Bike Scan |
| `ProfileController` | `LocalStore` (`camp_rider_profile`) | Dashboard, ProfileScreen, EditProfileScreen |
| `SettingsController` | `LocalStore` (`camp_settings`) | Settings screen, NavigationController (units), Emergency SOS |
| `MaintenanceController` | `LocalStore` via `MaintenanceRepository` | ServiceScheduleScreen, FinanceRigHealthScreen, HomeScreen |
| `ServiceVisitController` | `LocalStore` via `MaintenanceRepository` | NextServiceVisitCard, PlanServiceVisitSheet, MarkServiceDone |
| `PostRideReportController` | `LocalStore` (`camp_post_ride_reports`) | MaintenanceScreen (PostRide tab, Diagnostics engine), RideHistory |
| `TripBudgetController` | `LocalStore` (`camp_trip_budget`, `camp_trip_expenses`) | FinanceRigHealth screen and all expense sub-screens |
| `MechanicController` | `LocalStore` (`camp_mechanics_list`) | MechanicsHomeScreen, AddMechanicScreen |

`NavigationController` is **not** a singleton — it is created and disposed per `NavigationMapScreen` lifecycle. It reads `ActiveBikeController` (for fuel estimates) and `SettingsController` (for metric/imperial units) and includes strict `_disposed` lifecycle guards.

### Persistence Layer (`LocalStore`)

`LocalStore` wraps `SharedPreferences` with:
- **Ordered write queue** — a chained `Future<void> _writeQueue` guarantees writes complete in submission order, preventing a later write from overtaking an earlier one.
- **`flush()`** — awaits the entire queue; called on app lifecycle `paused / inactive / detached` via `WidgetsBindingObserver` in `CampApp`.
- **Transactional Rollback** — UI optimistically reflects changes and rolls back with an `AppMessenger` alert if storage operations fail.
- **Schema versioning** — `camp_schema_version` key guards against loading data from a future schema version.
- **First-run seeding** — `camp_first_run_completed` gates whether defaults are seeded on install.

## Registered Routes

All route strings are declared as constants in [`lib/app/routes.dart`](lib/app/routes.dart). **One constant per screen, no duplicates.**

| Route | Screen | Feature |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `HomeScreen` | Dashboard |
| `/sign-in` | `SignInScreen` | Auth |
| `/sign-up` | `SignUpScreen` | Auth |
| `/forgot-password` | `ForgotPasswordScreen` | Auth |
| `/add-bike` | `AddMotorcycleScreen` | Bike Scan |

| `/bike-details` | `BikeDetailsScreen` | Bike Scan |
| `/garage` | `GarageScreen` | Garage |
| `/bike-profile` | `BikeProfileScreen` | Garage |
| `/profile` | `ProfileScreen` | Dashboard |
| `/edit-profile` | `EditProfileScreen` | Dashboard |
| `/mechanics` | `MechanicsHomeScreen` | Mechanics |
| `/add-mechanic` | `AddMechanicScreen` | Mechanics |
| `/navigation/map` | `NavigationMapScreen` | Navigation |
| `/voice-copilot` | `VoiceAssistantScreen` | Voice Copilot |
| `/route-packs` | `RoutePacksScreen` | Navigation |

| `/predictive-maintenance` | `MaintenanceScreen(initialTab: diagnostics)` | Maintenance |
| `/carburetor-tuning` | `MaintenanceScreen(initialTab: carburetor)` ¹ | Maintenance |
| `/settings` | `SettingsScreen` | Settings |
| `/emergency-sos` | `EmergencySosScreen` | Emergency SOS |

> ¹ EFI bikes automatically fall back to the Diagnostics tab.
>
> **Legacy aliases** (kept for backwards compatibility):
> `/mechanics/map` → `NavigationMapScreen` · `/mechanics/voice-assistant` → `VoiceAssistantScreen`

## Feature Details

### Dashboard (`features/dashboard/`)
- **HomeScreen** — cockpit landing: active bike card with live GPS fuel calculation, voice bar, dynamic maintenance alert reading from schedule engine with "+N more due" expandable link, recent updates feed, floating `CampBottomNav`.
- **ProfileScreen** — rider overview: cockpit hero, touring tier, trail badges, garage summary, ride health, SOS medical ID.
- **EditProfileScreen** — form editor for rider personal details.

### Bike Scan (`features/bike_scan/`)
- **AddMotorcycleScreen** — entry hub: Scan Bike (camera) or View Garage.
- **BikeScanScreen** — camera with 8-second timeout, "Starting camera…" status, manual-entry fallback.
- **BikeDetailsScreen** — multi-step spec form; on save calls `ActiveBikeController.addBike()`.

### Garage (`features/garage/`)
- **GarageScreen** — fleet list, bike switcher, remove bike.
- **BikeProfileScreen** — full spec sheet, service records, active bike toggle.
- **Bike model** — `id`, `make`, `modelName`, `modelYear`, `odometerKm`, `fuelSystem` (`efi` | `carburetor`), `carburetorType`, `fuelTankCapacityLiters`, `fuelAverageKmPerLiter`, `ridingTerrain`, `lastOilChange`, `lastTuneUp`, `vin`, `nickname`, `imagePath`.

### Maintenance & Service Schedule (`features/maintenance/`)
- **Rider-Set Service Schedule Engine**:
  - Deterministic arithmetic per motorcycle; no silent defaults, no sensor dependencies, and no estimated costs.
  - Configurable items: Oil & Small Service, Oil Filter, Air Filter, Drive Chain, Spark Plug, Valve Tuning, Brakes, Tyres, Battery, Carburetor.
  - Harsh conditions mode shortens distance intervals by 20% (`intervalKm * 0.80`).
  - Status classification: `Not set up`, `Add last done`, `Overdue`, `Due soon`, `OK`.
  - Predictions project due dates from 7+ days of logged debriefs and odometer progress.
- **Multi-Bike Maintenance**:
  - `BikeLabelChip` displays bike model/nickname and license plate.
  - Prefilled with the active bike; backwards compatible with "No bike" legacy records.
- **Finances & Rig Health**:
  - Trip budget (`TripBudgetController`) + maintenance item list with rollback protection on disk errors.
  - Refill sheet calculates dynamically across any two of litres, price per litre, and total paid in PKR.

### Bike Scan & Optical Onboarding (`features/bike_scan/`)
- **AddMotorcycleScreen** — photo picker ("Take Bike Photo") and manual entry.
- **BikeDetailsScreen** — manual entry form (make, model, year, plate, odometer, fuel average, fuel system); photo card with preview, change, and remove. No fake detection banner or hardcoded defaults.
- **Typed Recognition Plug-in Point** — `BikeRecognitionResult` and `BikeRecognitionService` interface (cleanly parked for backend Firebase AI Logic with Gemini without any local mock). `populateFromRecognition` fills only detected fields and leaves odometer, fuel level, VIN, nickname, and fuel system unassigned.

### Navigation (`features/navigation/`)
- **NavigationMapScreen** — OSM vector map (`flutter_map`), OSRM routing, Nominatim geocoding, GPS position stream, wakelock during active guidance, topo/standard layer toggle, POI markers (mechanic · fuel · rest stop).
- **NavigationController** states: `idle → previewing → navigating → arrived`. Off-route detection (>50 m from polyline for 3 consecutive fixes) triggers reroute (throttled to 1 per 10 s). Includes safe disposal lifecycle guard.
- **RoutePacksScreen** — offline route packs displaying honest "Coming soon" status. Clean header without unbacked "Topo V4.8" sync buttons. Persistent Wi-Fi auto-update preference toggle via `SettingsRepository`.

### Mechanics (`features/mechanics/`)
- **MechanicsHomeScreen** — directory with honest straight-line distance via Haversine formula ($R = 6371.0\text{ km}$, only displayed when shop coordinates and user phone GPS are present). Pull-to-refresh reload. Clean header without unbacked "GPS LOCKED" pill.
- **Real Filter Chips** — exactly 3 filter chips ("All", "Open now", "Emergency Pitstop") with live, non-fabricated counts. "Open now" derives from deterministic opening-hours arithmetic (days, hours, 24h, overnight shifts).
- **AddMechanicScreen** — workshop registration form with photo picker, latitude/longitude coordinates, opening hours builder, and persistent local storage.

### Emergency SOS (`features/emergency_sos/`)
- Emergency number selector (1122, 15, 115, custom).
- Dedicated Emergency QR screen with real scannable payload, per-field privacy toggles, and PNG/PDF export.
